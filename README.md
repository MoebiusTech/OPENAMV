OpenAMV is an AI visual and voice development board designed based on RV1103. The onboard rich GPIO can be used.
RV1103G is a highly integrated IPC SoC suitable for AI vision related applications.
Based on a single core ARM Cortex-A7 32-bit kernel, it integrates NEON and FPU. There is a 32KB I-cache and a 32KB D-cache
And 128KB L2 cache. The built-in NPU supports mixed operations of INT4/INT8/INT16, with a computing power of up to 0.5TOPs. Additionally, due to its powerful compatibility
The network models of frameworks such as TensorFlow/MXNet/PyTorch/Caffe can be easily converted.
RV1103G introduces a new generation of fully hardware based image signal processors. The chip directly inherits numerous algorithm accelerators,
Such as HDR, 3A, LSC, 3DNR, 2DNR, sharpening, defogging, gamma correction, etc. Paired with two MIPI CSIs (or LVDS RX), use
Users can support multi camera video data
